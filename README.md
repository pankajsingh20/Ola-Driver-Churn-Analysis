# Ola-Driver-Churn-Analysis
This project aims to analyze and predict the churn rate of drivers on the Ola platform using historical data. By identifying key factors that influence driver retention, the analysis provides valuable insights to help the company reduce churn and improve driver engagement.

Objectives:
Analyze the historical data of Ola drivers to identify patterns and trends associated with churn.
Use various data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
Visualize key factors influencing churn and the effectiveness of different strategies in retaining drivers.

Key Tools & Technologies:
Python: For data cleaning, analysis, and machine learning model development.
Pandas, NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data visualization to identify trends and insights.
Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive coding and report generation.

Key Insights:
Identified factors such as low ratings, long working hours, and low earnings as key drivers of churn.
Proposed strategies for improving driver retention, including incentive programs and better support systems.

Outcome:
The analysis provided actionable insights that can help Ola reduce driver churn by targeting high-risk drivers and implementing retention strategies. This project highlights the use of data-driven approaches to solve business challenges in the ride-hailing industry.
